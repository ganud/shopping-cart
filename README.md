# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a React router shopping cart SPA using FakeStoreAPI

I sorta used Typescript on accident and it didn't really help here. I don't know to define more complex data types like the JSON objects I used here, and there's probably a learning curve for integrating it with React.

What I did learn was CSS modules, and having local css across multiple files was a lot LESS stressful. Bless non-conflicting class names.
